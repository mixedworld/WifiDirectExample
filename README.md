# WifiDirectExample
This is a demo for the UnityWifiDirect library for bringing Wifi p2p to Android

It allows the user to connect to a nearby device, and set the color of a cube. Then, after the send button is pressed, the other person's cube will change to the same color.

The built APK is in ./app.apk in the repo
